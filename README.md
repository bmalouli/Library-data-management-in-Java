#### This is my first Java project that I did at school 10 months ago and that I just pushed from Eclipse to GitHub. The interface is built with Java Swing and the database is built using Excel.

## Main window
- Library information at the top, with a translucent black background.

## Library policy window
- Use a larger font size for better readability. Display the library policy from a text block since this information is static.

## Data in the Excel file
- Each table is represented by a sheet in the Excel file. This can be easily compared to the organization of a relational database. Below is an example with the sheet (comparable to a table in a database) 'articles'.

## Deleting articles
- Ability to select one or multiple articles.
- Once the articles are selected and the button is pressed, delete the articles from the Excel sheet and update the display in the application.
